# Turner_CSCI2270_FinalProject
I am the only person working on my project.
The purpose of this project is to expand upon assignment 10, involving Dijkstras algorithm. The goal is to add many different search algorithms, including Dijkstras, and comparing them to one another to see which one is the most efficient for the given set of data. The user will have the ability to choose between a variety of search algoritms to apply to the data.
